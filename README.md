# Supplementary Material – *The first single-stranded DNA virus targeting Pectobacterium belongs to the family Microviridae and demonstrates a broad hostrange to Pectobacterium brasiliense isolates *

This repository contains supplementary data associated with the manuscript:  
**“First single-stranded DNA Microvirus targeting *Pectobacterium* belonging to the subfamily *Bullavirinae***”  
(Currently under review / not yet published)

The material includes protein structure and phylogenetic analyses performed on major proteins from genus representatives within the subfamily *Bullavirinae* (family *Microviridae*), with **phage phiMH2K** used as the outgroup in all analyses.

## Repository Structure  

### 1. `Foldseek/`  
Contains protein structure comparison files used in **Foldseek** analysis.  
- **Subfolders:** `gpA/`, `gpB/`, `gpH/`, `gpF/`  
  - Each folder includes:
    - `.pdb` files for proteins from genus representatives of *Bullavirinae*  
    - The corresponding protein from **phage phiMH2K** (outgroup)  
    - Resulting `.nwk` tree files from Foldseek output  

### 2. `Phylogeny_fr/`  
Contains phylogenetic analysis files generated using **Phylogeny.fr** (One Click mode).  
- **Subfolders:** `gpA/`, `gpB/`, `gpH/`, `gpF/`  
  - Each folder includes:
    - Multiple sequence alignments in `.fasta` format (amino acid sequences)  
    - Resulting `.nwk` tree files

## Notes  
- All proteins analyzed: **gpA, gpB, gpH, gpF**  
- Outgroup: **phiMH2K phage proteins**  
- Analyses cover representative members of the *Bullavirinae* subfamily.  
- Files are provided for reproducibility and as supplementary reference material.
